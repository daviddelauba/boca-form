Hi! "boca-form" is my 2nd project. 

I'm a Boca Juniors fan, so I wanted to make a page related to this soccer team.

I developed this project as part of the Responsive Web Design course at Freecodecamp, but I met the requirements to deliver it in 3 hours. 

I thought it was fun, so I continued anyway. I invested a few dozen more hours in customizing and perfecting it as much as possible.

It was the first time I used CSS intensively and extensively with HTML. Now I feel for the first time that I have a decent fluency in both languages.

I learned a lot. I loved doing it not by reading or listening to a tutorial but as part of a problem-solving process that culminated in a functional and beautiful site.
